# Game-of-Life

**Will update README as more progress is made**

An attempt at creating Conway's Game of Life mostly from scratch in C#.  I came across this idea recently and thought it would be a fun challenge to

## Goals

  **Required**
  - An interactable GUI for viewing the game
  - Have a (pseudo) infinite grid on which to play the game
  - Zoom and pan functionallity
  - Allow user to create input patterns before starting the game
	
  **Extra**
  - Customizable colors of "living" and "dead" cells
  - An option to pause the game
