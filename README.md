# Game-of-Life

**Will update README as more progress is made**

An attempt at creating Conway's Game of Life mostly from scratch in C#.  I came across this idea recently and thought it would be a fun challenge to 
try to implement a representation of Life withiut following any comprehensive tutorials.  

## Goals

  **Required**
  - An interactable GUI for viewing the game
  - Have a (pseudo) infinite grid on which to play the game
  - Zoom and pan functionallity
  - Allow user to create input patterns before starting the game
	
  **Extra**
  - Customizable colors of "living" and "dead" cells
  - An option to pause the game
  - ...

## In-progress / near future
  - ~~an option to translate generated patterns in unit tests~~
  - stress testing 
  - ~~start working on graphical representation~~
  - **see project boards**
